      <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none"><em>Trading of Vanguard ETFs within participant retirement accounts for Vanguard Retirement Plan Access will differ from how ETFs generally trade within a retail brokerage account, where investors can buy and sell shares of an ETF at market prices that change throughout the day. Ascensus uses the following method for processing trades of Vanguard ETFs in a participant account:</em></p>
      <ul class="vanguard-mar-b-none">
        <li><em>Participants can submit and confirm transactions to buy or sell shares of ETFs and all other investments in the plan, including mutual funds, during the day until 3 p.m. Eastern time (or one hour before the market close time when there is an early market close).</em></li>
        <li><em>Trades may only be submitted once per day.</em></li>
        <li><em>Individual participant ETF buy trades will be aggregated with all other ETF buy trades submitted to Ascensus for that day. Likewise, individual participant ETF sell trades will be aggregated with all other ETF sell trades submitted to Ascensus for that day.</em></li>
        <li><em>A participant’s ETF trade will be processed using an “average share price” for the day that the participant’s trade is submitted. The average share price for an ETF is based on the average price of the aggregate buy and sell trades submitted through Ascensus on that day for that ETF for all plans serviced by Ascensus. Therefore, participants will not receive the intraday market prices for the purchase or sale of shares of an ETF. In addition, the closing market price of an ETF, which will be used to value participant ETF holdings, may differ from the average share price.</em></li>
        <li><em>The following transaction costs are also factored into the average share price: brokerage commissions, which are estimated to be $0.015 per ETF share traded by Ascensus, and securities transaction fees on the sale of ETF shares.</em></li>
        <li><em>For more information on the securities transaction fees, please visit <a href="http://sec.gov/answers/sec31.htm">sec.gov/answers/sec31.htm</a>.</em></li>
        <li><em>The commissions and fees listed here are estimates only and are provided as of the date of this document. The commissions and fees associated with ETF trades are subject to change without notice. Other fees and commissions may also apply from time to time.</em></li>
        <li><em>The market value of participant accounts could fluctuate daily based upon the market value prices of the investments participants choose to invest in.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none"><strong>All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.</strong></p>
      <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none"><em>An investment in a stable value fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. There is no assurance that the fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value and it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.</em></p>
      <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,879,964; 7,337,138; 7,720,749; 7,925,573; 8,090,646; and 8,417,623.</p>
      <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none">Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer’s ability to make payments. While U.S. Treasury or government agency securities provide substantial protection against credit risk, they do not protect investors against price changes due to changing interest rates. Although the income from the U.S. Treasury obligations held in the fund is subject to federal income tax, some or all of</p>

      <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none">that income may be exempt from state and local taxes. High-yield bonds generally have medium-and lower-range credit quality ratings and are therefore subject to a higher level of credit risk than bonds with higher credit quality ratings. Prices of mid- and small-cap stocks often fluctuate more than those of large-company stocks. Investments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/ regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Derivatives are subject to a number of risks, such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, and management risk. A fund investing in a derivative instrument could lose more than the principal amount invested.</p>
