  <h1>Low cost actually can mean more for retirement</h1>
  <p>A fund lineup that consists of low-cost funds can make a difference. In our example below, you’ll see that using Vanguard funds can help your participants save more for retirement.</p>
  <p class="vanguard-mar-b-none">A plan participant who...</p>
  <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
    <li>Has a starting salary of $50,000 per year, which grows 2% annually</li>
    <li>Joins the plan at age 25 and retires at age 65 (40 years)</li>
    <li>Contributes 8% annually<sup>3</sup></li>
    <li>Earns a 6% annual investment return</li>
  </ul>
  <p>...will have more than $97,000 more in retirement.</p>
  <p>Thanks in part to our low asset-weighted average expense ratio of 0.12% (versus the industry average of 0.62%), participants can enjoy investment cost savings that translate into higher account balances. This example reflects an industry-average account balance of $733,359 and a Vanguard account balance of $830,666—providing $97,307 more in retirement.</p>
  <p>You can consult with your financial professional to determine the best lineup to meet the needs of your participants.</p>
